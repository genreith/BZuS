Quantum Collapse And Space-time Arise From Swarm Dynamics

ABSTRACT
General relativity and quantum mechanics describe seemingly incompatible traits of our universe. 
Their unification into a theory-of-everything challenged physics for the last century. 
Here I present GenI (for generic intelligence), a model inspired by artificial intelligence that satisfies 
both fundamental theories. 
GenI comprises a random walk process operating on a swarm-like construct and implements the competition among 
a finite set of ideas. Without any parameter tuning, GenI precisely fulfils the predictions of quantum measurements 
while its dynamics locally satisfy Einsteinâ€™s field equation.
The model suggests, that the perceivable universe is evolving according to the collapse of its quantum state rather 
than a smoothly evolving wave function as widely believed in modern physics. Consequently, gravitation cannot be 
directly derived from quantum mechanics or vice versa. Both simply describe distinct perspectives onto the previously 
unknown swarm-like stochastic process operating at the very basis of our universe.
